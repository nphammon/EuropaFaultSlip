# EuropaFaultSlip

First run TidalStressGlobal.m
then run FaultSlip.m, adjust the friction coefficient as you see fit
also you can run this with a precribed stress amplitude, or give a lat lon and fault orientation
then run PlotFailureDepth.
then you can run simpleThermal2.m, to get a 2d temperature calculation.
